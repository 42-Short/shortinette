# Discord Server for Short Program
To streamline communication and avoid overwhelming the main student server, we've created a dedicated Discord server for the Short program. This server is designed to meet specific needs and enhance the overall experience for both participants and the Short team.

## Key Features
1. Dual-Purpose Communication:
    * Facilitates interaction between Short participants
    * Allows the Short team to communicate with participants and monitor the event
2. Efficient Information Retrieval:
    * Searchable by exercise
    * Serves as a reliable source of truth
    * Encourages self-help among participants
3. Organized Channel Structure:
    * Forum channels for specific topics:
        * One channel for technical issues
        * Separate channels for each module
## Server Template
We've created a template based on our server setup. However, please note:
* The template does not automatically include the community feature
* You will need to manually activate the community feature
* Forum channels must be created individually
## Setup Instructions
1. Use the provided server template as a starting point
2. Activate the community feature in your new server
3. Create forum channels:
* Technical Issues
* One for each module (e.g., Module 1, Module 2, etc.)
4. Set appropriate permissions for each channel
5. Invite participants and team members
## Best Practices
* Encourage participants to use the search function before asking questions
* Regularly pin important announcements or frequently asked questions
* Assign moderators to help manage the server and ensure a positive community experience
