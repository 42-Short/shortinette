## Announcement
We recommend posting the announcement _at least_ one month before you plan to start the Short. Participation requires a big time investment, and you want people to plan ahead.

As an example, [this](examples/ANNOUNCEMENT.md) is the announcement we made for our very first Rust Short. Feel free to use it and tweak it as you need!
