## Announcement
We recommend posting the announcement _at least_ one month before you plan to start the Short. Participation requires a big time investment, and you want people to plan ahead.

As an example, [this](examples/ANNOUNCEMENT.md) is the announcement we made for our very first Rust Short. Feel free to use it and tweak it as you need!

We posted the announcement on our campus Discord server, and opened a thread below it, where students could just type their GitHub usernames to sign up (see [Configuring Participants](SETUP.md#configuring-participants)).
