# It's finally time to get rusty @Students!

We are happy to announce that the Rust Short will take place from `07/10/2024` to `13/10/2024`.

##  🦀 What is Rust?

Did you know that about 70% of severe security bugs are caused by memory corruption? While this has a lot to do with skill-issues, (which we obviously do not have here at 42 hehe), languages that let you play loose with memory are definitely part of the problem. 

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety and performance. It's designed to be a safer alternative to languages like C/C++. Rust's main goal is to prevent memory-related vulnerabilities while maintaining high performance. It introduces a way of thinking about memory management that prevents many common issues.
### Why Rust is Awesome
1. **No segfaults:** Rust's ownership system prevents common pointer issues.
2. **No data races:** Easier, safer concurrency.
3. **Safety != slow:** Performance on par with C/C++.
4. **Goodbye Makefiles:** Cargo simplifies project management.
5. **Growing Demand:** Adopted by major tech companies.
##  🚀 Recommended Prerequisite

We recommend having completed the `minishell` and `philosophers` circle before participating in the Rust Piscine. These projects provide insights into C concurrency & memory management, and will help you better appreciate Rust's take on solving these challenges. If you haven't done so yet, don't worry—you can still participate! Just be prepared for a steeper learning curve 💪

##  🏊‍♂️ Details
- **Duration:** 7 days (`07/10/2024` - `13/10/2024`)
- **Daily Structure:**
    - Each day, you will receive a new module containing 8 exercises
- **Time Commitment:** The first 5 exercises (50%) take about 6 hours/day, plan at least 10 for passing with 100%
- **On-campus participation required**
